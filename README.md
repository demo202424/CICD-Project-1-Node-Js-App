Project-1-Node-Js-App
Project Description: 

Hello friends, today I am going to share a CI/CD project for a Node.JS Application using Jenkins Declarative Pipeline. It will fetch the code from the source code repo GitHub and then build the docker image and push it to the docker hub and Deploy that image through the docker-swarm in the 2 different virtual servers, which will be hosted in a VPC of AWS Cloud. And that Cloud Infrastructure will be created not manually but by Terraform. 

Sound's great !? then let's get started.
